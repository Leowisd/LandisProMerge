The latest version of my work is under the folder LANDIS_7.1_merged(after tracking flag).
This version is based on the merged version, and other than that, it contains the tracking switch that control if the program track the 
dead tree number & dead tree bio mass & dead tree basal area in Fire&Fuel&Harvest&Succession module to save memory if you run this on a huge map.
The switch is in the most basic parameter data file which is parameter.dat in current folder. There is a bottom line in this parameter file and some comment to explain. 
And also I fixed the creating folder bug, from this version on, you don't have to create folder in the output directory manually anymore.
